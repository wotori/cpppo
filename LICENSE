Cpppo is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3 and is also
available under alternative licenses negotiated directly with Dominion Research
& Development Corp.  If you obtained Cpppo under the GPL, then the GPL applies
to all Cpppo modules used on your system as well, except as defined below. The
GPL (version 3) is included in this source tree in the file COPYING.

Hard Consulting Corporation holds copyright and/or sufficient licenses to all
components of the Cpppo package, and therefore can grant, at its sole
discretion, the ability for companies, individuals, or organizations to create
proprietary or Open Source (even if not GPL) modules which may use at runtime
the portions of Cpppo which fall under our copyright/license umbrella, or
are distributed under more flexible licenses than GPL.

If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs, don't worry -- there is no
requirement that you provide the same exception in your GPL'd products (although
if you've written a module for Cpppo we would strongly encourage you to make the
same exception that we do).

In addition, Cpppo implements many other communications protocols.  It is our
belief that applications using these protocols to manage or control a Cpppo
instance do not have to be licensed under the GPL or a compatible license, as we
believe these protocols do not create a 'derivative work' as referred to in the
GPL.  However, should any court or other judiciary body find that these
protocols do fall under the terms of the GPL, then we hereby grant you a license
to use these protocols in combination with Cpppo in external applications
licensed under any license you wish.
