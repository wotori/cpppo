# BACKGROUND
# 
#     When __new__ returns an instance of its cls, standard Python object
# creation invokes its __init__; we don't want to do this, if we detect a
# compatible x-ing iterator (including, specifically, an instance of x-ing
# itself).  Therefore, we cannot simply implement the __new__ classmethod on the
# x-ing class; we must create a different class, called x-able which checks if
# the provided iterator has the required capabilities of an x-ing, and returns
# the original (already compatible) iterator if so.  Otherwise, it creates an
# instance of the required x-ing class over the supplied iterator, and returns
# it.  Since Python detects that x-able's __new__ returned an x-ing instance or
# something like it (certainly not an x-able instance), Python doesn't invoke
# its __init__.

    On entry, processes the pending source symbol (if implemented), and then reports the outgoing
    transition state (if any) based on the next source symbol.  If a state requires a source symbol
    to process, it must be available (and acceptable) to process when the state is entered.

    On exit, a state may issue non-transition events (machine, None) when no input symbol is
    available, or when no outgoing transitions are available for the pending source symbol.

    The base 'state' is a Null (no-input) state, which neither tests nor consumes an input value,
    but simply transitions to the next appropriate state if a matching transition exists.  Useful
    for decision points, eg:

        q		= state( "Quoted String" )
        q['"']		= quoted_double
        q["'"]		= quoted_single

    Implements the basic state transition generator structure, returning non-transition events
    (machine,None) 'til an input that the state accepts/validate is available, then processed, and
    then an input matching an outgoing edge in the underlying dictionary is seen.

    This allows composition of state machines; the higher level machinery runs the lower level
    machine transition generator, passing through state changes 'til done (StopIteration), watching
    for non-transition events.  When one occurs, the higher level machinery must change the
    environment (consume the next source symbol using its own state machinery, chain fresh input to
    the source symbol generator, discard the sub-machines and supply the remaining input to a new
    one, ...)

    If no transition can be determined based on the next input symbol, more complex transitions can
    be configured, which may access the entire machine state, as well as the input symbol 'source',
    and the 'data' artifact.

    If a limit on the number of possible input symbols is known (or will be known at run-time), it
    can be provided as limit.  Protocols will often include a length field specifying the size of
    the upcoming portion of the protocol; this can be provided to the dfa as a limit, preventing the
    machine from consuming more input than it should.  The ending symbol is computed after this
    state processes its input symbol (if any).  The incoming symbol source iterator's .sent property
    is tested before transitioning, and transitioning is terminated if the computed ending symbol

        Once processed successfully, computes and yields the outgoing state, or None if no matching

        None), but current state is not terminal.  If greedy, will continue as long as transitions
        are available; otherwise, the machine will stop as soon as a terminal state reached.

        Loops yielding non-transition (machine,None) until we've found an input that passes
        accepts/validate to process.  This will allow higher levels of the state machine to process
        pending inputs unrecognized by this machine, allowing it to proceed.

        Then, loops yielding non-transitions until we find an outgoing state for the pending input
        symbol (or no transition, but the state is terminal); the state is yielded, and the

        This may seem strange, but we want to keep "punting" (giving higher level state machinery a
        crack at the current unrecognized input symbol) 'til we're left with one we can handle.
        This allows lower level machines to process some input and "push" a new symbol
        (unrecognizable to this level, but usable by a higher level), finally proceeding when that
        symbol is processed by the higher level machine.

        We deal with preventing an infinite of non-transition (machine,None), either due to not
        finding an acceptable input symbol, or not being able to find an acceptable output
        transition, by seeing if we are about to yield the same state, with the exact same input
        symbol and number of symbols sent (a no-progress loop).  In either case, if we're not a
        terminal state, we raise a NonTerminal exception.  This is the standard failure mode of a

            generator may proceed to process the remaining input).

        may specify a transition to None (input symbol unacceptable) on any input; this is necessary

        default), we'll continue to produce transitions until we reach a terminal state and cannot
        transition on the next input symbol.  


        If a state isn't terminal and cannot transition, it may yield non-transition events forever.
        This may seem a bit like OCD, but remember -- this is a base class, and derived classes may
        define self.terminal in complex ways; we may "become" terminal later... Normally, you'd wrap
        a machine made out of 1 or more raw state objects in a dfa (which detects no-progress
        loops), instead of using it directly.

        If a state is greedy and cannot transition, but transition might be possible given the right
        symbol, it must yield non-transitions 'til there is an input symbol available.  Otherwise,
        we cannot know for certain whether or not the state could have transitioned, had there been
        input available.  If we do not wait, the state machine will have different behaviour,
        depending on whether the next input symbol was immediately available, or if we had to yield
        a non-transition to give the caller a chance to acquire input.

        If we've become symbol limited, we must only follow None transitions; we don't want to
        consider the next input symbol at all, because it could lead us down a "choice" path,
        instead of allowing us to successfully stop at  a erminal state.

        TODO: Consider whether we should look for and quit at the first available terminal state,
        once we've become symbol limited (basically, stop being greedy as soon as we're limited).
        This would prevent us from going into "idle" states (ones we want to enter whenever we're
        stopped awaiting input.)  Is this valuable?  We might be able to distinguish between

        deal in a stream of bytes, then we need to convert the greenery.fsm transition symbols from
        str to str/int (on Python 2/3).  If 'encoder' is supplied, then we can use this for the
        conversion; it must be a generator that produces 1 or more encoded symbol for each input
        symbol.

        A greenery.fsm is also designed to be greedy on failure; it will accept and consume any
        unaccepted characters in a final non-terminal state.  Recognize these dead states and
        drop them; we want to produce a state machine that fails on invalid inputs.

        Returns the resultant regular expression string and lego representation, the fsm, and the
        initial state of the resultant state machine:

    r"""When combined with a regex class, collects a string matching the regular expression, and puts it
    in the data artifact at path.context 'string' by default.

    The default initial=".*\n", greedy=False configuration scans input only until the regular
    expression is satisfied (by default, not satisfied 'til it sees a newline) and does no other
    validation, much like the get(3) C library function.

    Other more likely use cases would be to specify specific included character validation, and use
    the greedy=True configuration to scan until the next symbol doesn't satisfy the regular
    expression, or some other feature limits the length of the match:

        initial='.*', greedy=True, length=5	# exactly 5 of any character
        initial='[\w\s]*', greedy=True		# scan letters, numbers, _ and whitespace 'til exhausted
        initial='\d*', greedy=True		# as many digits as can be found

    Alternatively, you could specify regex_alphabet=..., and provide a type, a set/list/tuple of
    acceptable symbols (anything with a __contains__ method), or a function to test the upcoming
    symbol for acceptability.

    If no decode= keyword parameter is provided, it is assumed that the data is already encoded in
    the desired encoding, and doesn't need to be decoded from raw bytes into another encoding.  This
    will generally be the case when the underlying regex is operating on native Python str types
    (ascii or latin-1 in Python 2, utf-8 in Python 3).  When operating on raw bytes, however, a
    target encoding should be provided.  

    In Python 2, it is not possible to differentiate between raw bytes (str) and native
    ascii/latin-1 strings (str).  So, if you're operating in raw bytes and you don't provide an
    encoding, you will be left with a Python str containing the raw bytes; perhaps usable, if the
    data represents information in an 8-bit character set, such as ascii, latin-1/iso-8859-1.  If
    you provide a decode= specification, it will be used -- and yeild (perhaps unexpectedly) a
    Python2 unicode type containing codepoints valid in the specified encoding.

    In Python 3, raw bytes (bytes) and native strings (str, which are utf-8) are distinguishable,
    and you must decode bytes into a specified encoding (eg. iso-8859-1, utf-8, ...) in order to
    yield a python string; if you don't provide a decode= specification, you'll be left with bytes;
    perhaps not what you expect.

    When processing raw bytes data, provide a decode=..., and be prepared to handle the resultant
    unicode/str result.  When processing non-bytes data, you don't have to provide a decode=
    parameter, and the resultant Python str will contain symbols in the original encoding.
